MAKE A CALCULATOR

Run the program (AppMain.java). You should see a calculator window that looks similar to the default Calculator app you have on your Windows computer.
Click the buttons. They don't do anything. Except for the '1' button.

Your task is to implement as many of the buttons as you can. Ideally, you will make it so that its behavior ends up pretty similar to the Windows calculator.

There is one major difference expected between your calculator and the Windows calculator!!!
In your calculator, we don't respect the standard order of operations. We just work left-to-right.
That means "2 + 2 / 2 =" should be 2. If you put this on a real calculator, "2 + 2 / 2 =" would be 3.

The calculator UI looks like this:

+===============+
|  Scientific   |
|       1 + 2 + | <=== "Expression": the previous sequence of operations/functions
|             3 | <=== "Entry": either the number that the user is currently entering, or the result of the previous calculation (if the user has not started entering a new number)
|MC MR M+ M- MS | <=== Memory buttons
| x x x x x x x |
| x x x x x x x |
| x x x x x x x |
| x x 7 8 9 x x | <=== Digit/function/operator buttons
| x x 4 5 6 x x |
| x x 1 2 3 x x |
| x x x 0 . x x |
+===============+


CODE EXPECTATIONS

You should EDIT code in the Calculator class (in the "student" folder).
You shouldn't edit code in other files.

You should USE constants from the Buttons class (in the "constants" folder). This is already imported into Calculator.java for you, so you can reference these constants like "Buttons.PLUS", for example.
You should USE methods from the EngineAPI class (in the "internal" folder). This is already *statically* imported into Calculator.java for you, so you can call these methods like "isEntryIncomplete()" for example.
See the tooltips/docs of EngineAPI for method info.
You shouldn't use code from other files.


GETTING STARTED

- Handle digits 0 to 9 by appending to the "entry" when the button is pressed. Confirm that it shows on the display.
- Handle the "2nd" button, using the appropriate EngineAPI function to swap the other buttons.
- Handle an operator or function, such as "+". What do you need to store or calculate when the operator button is clicked? Can you update the "expression" too?
- Handle the decimal point to support floating-point numbers.
- Handle the "=" symbol. This one can be quite weird based on the previous state.
- Handle the memory buttons, such as "MS" and "MR".
- Handle the "C"/"CE" buttons. Can you swap the button between the two at the right time? Can you clear the correct data when they are clicked?

Remember that this is supposed to be an extra challenge. If you get stuck on something, you can often take a break and work on a different part of the program.
